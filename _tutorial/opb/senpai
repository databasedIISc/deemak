...Hey bro! What's going on here?
...Some meeting, first time in OPB? Expectations vs Reality isn't it?
...Sort of yeah. Anything I can help with?
...What are you doing here?
...(nervously) Oh nothing, a friend called. Do you know some common place people talk here?
...Yeah almost all OPB is a common place to talk. Might as well check out wifiroom?
...Right, thanks!
