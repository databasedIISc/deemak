The password of OPB wifi is soo funny. Guess what? It's the_same_password!
...(You) Did wifi even exist in 1991?

I remember this building used to Physics lab of CV Raman! Now it's used for undergraduates lectures and labs. He used to keep all his passwords the same. *_**_**** format. Too obvious!

...(You) UG program started after 2010. Someone is messing around. Yet also gave awesome info!
