...I have no clue.
...I heard the fact the real bugs used to be there in the machine previously, hence the term "debugging". I wonder which insects used to go there.
...(Searched on Net)
...I see, I think the order of these insects are maybe worth a `save` in my memory.

** Task 13: Let's look at `save` and `restore` command. **
- `save` command saves all the progress done by you, including unlocks, file created/deleted, etc.
- `restore` commands, as intuition speaks, restores all progress since previous change. See their `help` for more information.
- You task is to `save`, make some changes(like creating and deleting) and `restore`. See what happens!
