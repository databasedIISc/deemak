You are love struck! Can't wait to finish the food and go. Although you know you have no hopes, but might as well go.

...(overhearing) I heard the password to OPB is some sort of a Riddle:

```
If you have me, 
you will want to share me
If you share me, 
you will not longer have me
```
...one word, all small.

** Task 5: Go to OPB. Meet your senpai. Use the `solve` command to get your password to OPB. In our case, try `solve mess` since you have solved `mess`. Follow the instructions you see. And then try `unlock` command to open OPB. Again, in our case, it will be `unlock opb` command. **
