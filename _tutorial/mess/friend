...(friend) Hi! 
...Do you know how to how to access OPB?
...Ah well, I think it is locked. You have to find the password somewhere. If you have any issues, just ask for `help`. Always there for help.
...Thanks!
...Now might as well have your food before it goes cold. :)

** Task 2: Eat your food. Try out the `help` command with `read` and `go` command, like `help read`, etc. **
