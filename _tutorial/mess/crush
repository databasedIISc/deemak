...(crush) Hi!
...(nervous) Hey.
(in your head - So cool and pretty!)
...Which courses are you planning to take?
...(stiffly) I haven't decided yet. Probably "Probability and Statistics", though statistically unlikely "Statistical Mechanics", cause it's grading is hard. Which ones are you taking?
...I am thinking to take those both plus "Virology" and "Organic Chemistry".
...(thinking - I hope I can become a virus and...) Oh yeah! That's cool. In that case I can go for some chemistry in life too. I am not so good at Biology Oops!
...Cool! Looking forward to seeing you in class :).

** Task 4: Create your course notebook.**
- Use `tap` to create files and directory.
- Use `del` to delete them.
- You task is to create `course` directory and add `UMA201`, `UPH201`, `UB202`, `UCH201`
- You realised you mistakenly add `UB202`. Delete it!

...(crush) Oh by the way, meet me at OPB at 2pm. I need to talk to you about something. See ya later ;)
...(You) .-.. . - ... .--- ..- ... - ..-. --- -.-. ..- ... --- -. ..-. --- --- -..
...(friend) Looks like you guys have something hidden going on.
